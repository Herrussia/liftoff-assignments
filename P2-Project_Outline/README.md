## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My application is designed to help educate users looking to start keeping and caring for plants. 
Plant keeping can be overwhelming with all the details and varied difficulty that goes in to plants that require more skill.
This application will help to craft a selection of plants that are specifically selected based off of the search parameters used
to determine which plants would best thrive in the users environment.
This idea came from the personal struggle I experienced when the pandemic started and I began keeping plants as a hobby.
I was quickly overwhelmed with how in depth of care some plants required, the types of plants, what would be toxic to myself and my pets, and
the overall variety of soil and lighting requirements that each plant needed.
The purpose of this application is to allieviate all the introductory stress associated with starting a new plant keeping hobby
so that users can enjoy keeping happy and healthy plants.

### Features
Search/List: The ability to search by an environmental condition or list plants by a specific category
User login: The prompting and authentication of user accounts to use the application
Post/Comments: In the details portion of the plant details, having the opportunity to comment and leave care tips for future users
